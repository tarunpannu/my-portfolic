Suraj Mal (13 February 1707 – 25 December 1763) was a Jat ruler of Bharatpur in present-day state of Rajasthan. Under him, the Jat rule covered the present-day districts of Agra, Aligarh, Bharatpur, Dholpur, Etawa, Hathras, Mainpuri, Mathura, and Rohtak.[3]

A contemporary historian had described him as "the Plato of the Jat tribe" and by a modern writer as the "Jat Ulysses", because of his "political sagacity, steady intellect and clear vision."[4] The people, under Suraj Mal, overran the Mughal garrison at Agra.[5] In addition to the troops stationed at his forts, he had an army of more than 75,000 infantry and more than 38,000 cavalry.</p>
